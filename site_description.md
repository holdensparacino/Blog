## Site Tools

I had a lot of fun building this site. I am self-taught in web design, and have listed a few of the tools and resources below that were helpful to me in this process. They may be useful to you also!

- This site uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com){:target="_blank"} to host and organize files. 
- The design uses a modified [Cayman](https://pages-themes.github.io/cayman/){:target="_blank"} theme.
