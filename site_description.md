<h2 class = "featured-text">About this site</h2>

This site was built by me as a place to keep my projects organized, and as a way for me to continue coding. External projects and work linked to through this site may indicate specific usage licenses. Unless otherwise noted, content on this site is copyrighted by Holden Sparacino. 

If you would like to use this content in other ways, or have questions about this site, please contact me below.

## Site tools

I had a lot of fun building this site. I am self-taught in web design, and have listed a few of the tools and resources below that were helpful to me in this process in the hope that they may be useful for you!

This site uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com){:target="_blank"} to host and organize files. 

The design uses a modified [Cayman](https://pages-themes.github.io/cayman/){:target="_blank"} theme.

You can see the source files [here](https://github.com/holdensparacino/holdensparacino.github.io){:target="_blank"}.

Shout out to [W3Schools](http://w3schools.com/){:target="_blank"} and [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/){:target="_blank"} for helping this novice coder out.
