Hello! I'm Holden, I'm passionate about water quality, bikes, and science communication. 

I work with Natural Resources Conservation Districts across the state of Vermont to develop and manage non-agricultural water quality projects as the [Water Quality Programs Manager](https://vacd.org) at the [Vermont Association of Conservation Districts](https://vacd.org). 

In my role at [VACD](https://vacd.org), I work to support water quality programs, develop new program and funding areas, and act as a connection between local priorities and state-wide networks. Previously I worked at the [University of Vermont](/thesis) to understand the current practices and impacts of winter maintenance on surface water quality, and have worked on [volunteer monitoring](/volmon) and [community-based research](/shale-gas) projects in the past.

Outside of my work, I am passionate about getting people on bikes, getting myself outside and traveling, and the occasional DIY project. Originally from California, I left for the East Coast a decade ago and have been adjusting to the winters ever since!

Here you'll find a mixture of my ongoing projects and personal pursuits. Enjoy!
