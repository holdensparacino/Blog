## About

<img src="/assets/profile.png" id="profile">

I am a graduate research student at the University of Vermont, interested in connecting communities to decisions about their water resources. Raised in California, I left for the East Coast a decade ago and have been trying to adjust to the winters ever since.

My thesis work aims to understand the practices that winter maintenance and snow removal private contractors adopt, the areas serviced and materials and equipment involved, and how snow removal companies learn best management practices. Ultimately, a long-term outcome of this work is to form recommendations and resources for private contractors aiming to reduce their environmental impacts on surface waters.

Outside of my research, I am passionate about getting people on bikes, getting myself outside and traveling, and the occasional DIY project. Here you'll find a mixture of my work projects and personal pursuits. Enjoy!
