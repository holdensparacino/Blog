## Water Quality Programs Manager | VACD

![vacd](/assets/vacd.jpg)

I work with Natural Resources Conservation Districts across the state of Vermont to develop and manage non-agricultural water quality projects at the [Vermont Association of Conservation Districts (VACD)](https://vacd.org){:target="_blank"} incluing efforts to restore river corridors, treat runoff through stormwater projects and tree plantings, and increase district capacity. 

This work includes developing and supporting new and existing program and funding areas through grants writing and management, acting as a connection between local priorities and state-wide networks, and general outreach. Some program areas include green stormwater infrastructure projects, river corridor restoration areas, and streamside buffer plantings.

I'm excited to continue connecting local priorities and expertise to implement water quality programs through this work, and have been inspired with the on-the-ground work done by Vermont's Conservation Districts!
